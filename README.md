# TestNG Framework Template

This repository provides a streamlined TestNG framework template configured for automated testing, designed specifically with only test components, JDK 21, and Maven. Itâ€™s ideal for modular test creation and can be easily adapted to multiple projects, with support for Excel-based data handling.

## Key Features

- **Test-Only Structure**: Organized solely around test classes for clarity and simplicity.
- **Excel Data Handling**: Integrates with Apache POI for reading and writing Excel files, enabling data-driven testing.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Configurable to run tests across various browsers.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates comprehensive reports for analysis and debugging.
- **Enhanced Error Logging**: Improved logging for easier troubleshooting.

## Framework Structure

- `src/test/java` - Contains all test cases, organized by modules.
- `resources/` - Holds configuration files, such as `config.properties` and any Excel test data files.
- `testng.xml` - Configures suite execution, test grouping, and parallel runs.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
      `git clone https://github.com/AshwaniCoding/TestNg-Framework.git`
      `cd TestNg Framework`

2. **Dependencies**: Ensure necessary dependencies, including `poi-ooxml`, are in your `pom.xml` for Maven management.

3. **Configuration**:
   - Edit `config.properties` for any environment-specific settings.
   - Modify `testng.xml` to set up suites, parallel execution, and other test parameters.

4. **Execute Tests**:
      mvn test  

## Reusing in Future Projects

To use this framework in new projects:
1. Copy the `src`, `resources`, and configuration files.
2. Update `testng.xml` and `config.properties` based on project requirements.
3. Add and customize test cases as needed, using Excel files for data-driven testing if applicable.

## Dependencies

- **JDK 21**
- **TestNG** (recommended version 7.0+)
- **Apache POI (poi-ooxml)** for Excel file operations
- **Selenium WebDriver** (for browser automation)
- **Maven** (for dependency and build management)
